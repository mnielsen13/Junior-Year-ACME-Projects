# Junior-Year-ACME-Projects

Welcome! Here you will find a sample of some of the projects that I completed my Junior Year in the Applied and Computational Mathematics Program at 
Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Many of these projects were originally coded up as .py files, but I have since converted them to Jupyter
Notebooks to more conveniently display output. Enjoy!
